![3D K-Means Clustering](../../assets/ALS_pics/3d_kmeans_pay.png)

K-means clustering was used to assess if STEM occupations cluster in a way to subvert or heavily influence the trend of men being paid more than women. The STEM occupations are in yellow and the non-STEM purple. However, from this three-dimensional graph, it is hard to see how much the STEM occupation data clusters.

The data for this analysis came from [“ACS 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample” for 2017 from the US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/) and from [Occupational Employment Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/topics.htm#stem)
