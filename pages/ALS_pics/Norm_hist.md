Given an apparent correlation between men's and women's pay, it is worth looking at this data in a different way that removes this inherent correlation. While it seems that pure numbers of women in an occupation does not make it more pay equitable, the differential in numbers between the genders may still have influence on the differential in pay. To test this, the data was manipulated to create two new variables: normalized pay differential and normalized number differential.

Neither element seems highly correlated with the other, a suspicion that was verified by their correlation coefficient of -0.156724. Moreover, the following histogram shows that the two elements do not even share a shape. The pay differential is a bell curve, while the number differential is not. The number differential does have a notable lean towards more occupations being populated by men than women -- interesting, but not for the current analysis.
